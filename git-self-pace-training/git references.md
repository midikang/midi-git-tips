There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.

Pull request
========
Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source projects and for managing changes to shared repositories. If you're using a Fork & Pull Model, Pull Requests provide a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider. If you're using a Shared Repository Model, Pull Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the master branch.

Merging Pull Requests
======================
At this point, your pull request should be approved and you are ready to merge it in to the master branch. When you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from your feature branch and adding it to the content and history of the master branch.

Many project teams have established rules about who should merge a pull request. Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge. Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency. Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request. There are also third party Continuous Integration (CI) tools you can integrate with GitHub to test the build before the merge is completed.
